There are plenty of mind-map Apps you can find. Personally, I recommend **ProcessOn**, whick is friendly to beginners & free-users. By "friendly", I mean already you have a lot of things to try with its free-account, only with limitations of those fancy templates and the number of mind-maps you can create. A free-user is allowed for 9 mind-maps, and one can easily add a few more by referring to others or complete his/her profile, etc..
