<p style="text-align:justify">Learning-by-doing is of course a great form of learning, especially for practical skills.<br> In order to learn QlikView, I started by making a dashboard myself, exploring as many features in QlikView as I can: I wrote codes for chart titles, chart colors, expressions; I tried to use the object of slider for date/time by aligning it to date axis of the line chart (this object is not commonly used in dashboards, however, I think in this way, it increases the effectiveness of date selection. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">But, later I was told by an expert in this field that making a user-friendly dashboard is not enough, and biulding a data model is equally important and time-consuming. Immediately I start off on this topic, by reading the help-file of QlikView, where there is a whole section of "Introduction to loading data".</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This is a dataset of the sales of a superstore, who has been offering discounts to its customers. Obviously, these discounts boosted sales, but caused somehow losses. </p>
  
<p style="text-align:justify">I have built <B>three dashboards</B> consisting of varieties of charts, see below the app embedded from Tableau Public and <B>click and explore</B>. I also used the feature of <B>clustering</B>, which is a data analysis tool offered since Tableau 10 based on the K-means clustering algorithm. </p>  
  
<p style="text-align:justify">The theme of the story is the profit pattern of this superstore. The first dashboard shows an overall picture of the selling performance; then the second dashboard analyses the buying habit of the customers; and the third dashboard summarizes the profitablity/discount strategy of the items in the superstore.</p>
