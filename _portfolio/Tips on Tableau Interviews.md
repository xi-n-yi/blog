For Tableau interviews, it is needless to say that you should have a good knowledge of Tableau and how to create visualizations in Tableau.<br/>

If you go for an interview, there is a chance that companies will talk to multiple candidates before deciding on the right candidate. More than likely, all these candidates will know Tableau, so you should try to stand apart from the rest.<br/>

# Tips on Tableau Interviews
* Focus on the concepts. What is Tableau and how it works. What are behind-the-scene concepts. How calculations work or how a query is processed when a visualization is created.
* You should know about Dimensions and Facts because that is one of the important concept on which Tableau charts are created. You should be able to explain the concept of dimensions and facts by drawing.
* Acquire a good knowledge about the best practices of creating dashboards and visualizations.
* Gain knowledge of discrete and continuous data elements and how they affect your visualizations.
* Explain why you like Tableau. You should know how Tableau differs from other similar tools like QlikView or IBM Cognos.
