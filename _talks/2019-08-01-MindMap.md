Mind map is a powerful tool for infomation organization. It promotes both **logical thinking** and **big-picture thinking**. 

Ways of using a mind map include but not limited to **event planning**, **decision making**, **brainstorming**, ect.. 

For me, I often use mind map to **take notes** when I am learning or reading, to **organize information** when I am writing a paper or planning a presentation. I also plan my to-do list using mind map, which can be easily set into the prevalent **Eisenhower Matrix**, aka, Urgent/Important Priciple. Simply setting four branches denoted as "(Not) Ungent and (Not) Important", I can fit my things-to-do as sub-branches into one of the four. And I can always move my things-to-do among the four branches, and create hierachy branches. Further, certain mind map tool such as *ProcessOn*, offers a feature of **recording a slide show**, with which one can show different portions of the mind map as slides while reminding the audience of the whole picture of his/her story. I am interested in giving a presentation using mind map. Hopefully, there will soon be a chance.

There are plenty of mind map Apps you can find. I recommend *ProcessOn* for starter, which is friendly to beginners & free-users. 

By "friendly", I mean already you have a lot of things to try with its free-account, only with limitations of those fancy templates and the number of mind-maps you can create. A free-user is allowed for 9 mind-maps, and one can easily add a few more by referring to others or complete his/her profile, etc.. However, you may be more than willing to pay for a full version, since you are so attached to this tool.
