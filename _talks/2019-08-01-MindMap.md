<p style="text-align:justify">Mind map is a powerful tool for infomation organization. It promotes both <B>logical thinking</B> and <B>big-picture thinking</B>. 

<br>Ways of using a mind map include but not limited to <B>event planning, decision making, brainstorming</B>, ect.. 

<br>For me, I often use mind map to <B>take notes</B> when I am learning or reading, to <B>organize information</B> when I am writing a paper or planning a presentation. I also plan my to-do list using mind map, which can be easily set into the prevalent <B>Eisenhower Matrix</B>, aka, Urgent/Important Priciple. Simply setting four branches denoted as "(Not) Ungent and (Not) Important", I can fit my things-to-do as sub-branches into one of the four. And I can always move my things-to-do among the four branches, and create hierachy branches. Further, certain mind map tool such as <i>ProcessOn</i>, offers a feature of <B>recording a slide show</B>, with which one can show different portions of the mind map as slides while reminding the audience of the whole picture of his/her story. I am interested in giving a presentation using mind map. Hopefully, there will soon be a chance.

<br>There are plenty of mind map Apps you can find. I recommend <i>ProcessOn</i> for starter, which is friendly to beginners & free-users. 

<br>By "friendly", I mean already you have a lot of things to try with its free-account, only with limitations of those fancy templates and the number of mind-maps you can create. A free-user is allowed for 9 mind-maps, and one can easily add a few more by referring to others or completing his/her profile, etc.. However, you may be more than willing to pay for a full version later on, when you find yourself so attached to this tool.
