<i>I pursued my Ph.D in Germany, and then joined a team in the Chinese Academy of Science, transformed my post-doctoral achievements, became the technical director of the startup company, Monta Vista Scientific Inc.(MVSI). 2 years ago, I moved to Boston, working remotely, and became a mom. I will be finishing most of my work in MVSI very soon, and moving on to pursue a bright new career as a data scientist. I am looking forward to the transformation.</i>
