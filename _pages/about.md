I have been trained and worked in the field of materials science for 10+ yearsï¼šI pursued my Ph.D in Germany, and then joined a team in the Chinese Academy of Science, transformed my post-doctoral achievements, became the technical director of the startup company, Monta Vista Scientific Inc.(MVSI). 2 years ago, I moved to Boston, working remotely, and became a mom. I will be finishing most of my work in MVSI very soon, and moving on to pursue a bright new career as a data scientist. I am looking forward to such a transformation.
